## Description:

The cinopsis movie web application created by Mindy Marmol, Peter Lutz, Ryan Zimmerman, and Suzann Adams is a place where creative storytellers can post a synopsis or short summary of their film ideas for the public to read and rate. This application is a site where an interested audience and potential screen writers can share and provide feedback in the form of rating the synopsis on a scale of 1 to 10 with the top five highest rated films, per genre, listed on the homepage. This site can be the launching pad for writers to eventually write a fully developed movie script that can be proposed to a filmmaker. The frontEnd of this app has eight components, they are: HeaderContainer, Home, Login, Movie, Signup, Submit, User, and ViewAll.

## Technologies Used:

The technologies used for cinopsis is React JSX, React Hooks and React Bootstrap and Axios. Flexbos and CSS Grid were also used to style the pages.

## Getting Started/Installation:

This application can be used by pulling it up on GitHub, forking it to your personal repository, then cloning and copying it into your terminal. The next step is to run npm install to install the required dependencies, then npm run start on your terminal to run the application in the browser.

## Future Additions:

In the future, we would like to add the feature of allowing a place for the user to provide written feedback to the author of the film, as well as, post an image or illustration that reflects the synopsis of the author's proposed film. Material posted on cinopsis will have copyrights attached to the login user who submitted the story and other legal protections.
