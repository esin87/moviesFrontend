## Description:

The Cinopsis movie web application created by Mindy Marmol, Peter Lutz, Ryan Zimmerman, and Suzann Adams is a place where creative storytellers can post a synopsis or short summary of their film idea for the public to read and rate. This application is a site where an interested public audience and potential or current screen writers can share, provide and receive feedback by rating the synopsis of the film on a scale of 1 to 10. The top five highest rated films, per genre, will be listed on the homepage. This site can be the launching pad for writers to eventually write a fully developed movie script that can be proposed to a filmmaker. The frontEnd of this app has nine components, they are: App, HeaderContainer, Home, Login, Movie, Signup, Submit, User, and ViewAll.

## Technologies Used:

The technologies used for cinopsis is React JSX, React Hooks and React Bootstrap and Axios. CSS Grid and Flexbox were also used to style the pages.

## Getting Started/Installation:

This application can be used by pulling it up on GitHub, forking it to your personal repository, then cloning and copying it into your terminal. The next step is to run npm install to install the required dependencies, then npm run start on your terminal to run the application in the browser. Then click onto the website and enjoy, otherwise you can also pull it up on Heroku. The link is listed again here: http://cinopsis.herokuapp.com/api/movies/

## Contribution Guidelines:

Contributors can open an issue on this repository at https://github.com/pjl4/bookFrontend if there are suggestions to improve this application.

## Problems & Difficulties:

1. It was difficult to get the API to link with the frontend of the app.
2. Calculating the ratings to have it sync up with the current page was a challenge.
3. Working on different branches caused some confusion for us when we had to save and merge then get the correct version of our app.
4. Some fetch calls we made were not initially functioning as we had hoped.

## Future Additions:

In the future, we would like to add the feature of allowing a place for the user to provide written feedback to the author of the film, as well as, post an image or illustration that reflects the synopsis of the author's proposed film. Material posted on cinopsis will have copyrights attached to the login user who submitted the story and other legal protections.
